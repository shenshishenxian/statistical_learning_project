# statistical_learning_project
This is the code repo for our statistical learning course. We have reproduced two papers and tried five new methods for the dataset. To learn more about our work, check out the project paper.


The code of our project are both in R and Python. We were using Python during the initial stage of our project simply because we are better at Python and we wanted to test algorithms with something we feel confident with. Later, we translated the Python code into R.
